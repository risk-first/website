# Contributors

If you feel something important is missing, or you spot a mistake, [we need help](https://github.com/risk-first/website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Although this is a collaborative Github project, it's not meant to be an open-ended discussion of software techniques like [Ward's Wiki](http://wiki.c2.com).  In order to be concise and useful, discussions need to be carried out by either:

 - **[Opening an Issue](https://github.com/risk-first/website/issues).**
 - **["Star"ing the project](https://github.com/risk-first/website/stargazers)**: this will cause you to be invited to join the Risk-First organisation

Ideas, issues and proof-reading:

- [Gustavo Andrade](https://github.com/gandrade)
- [George Bashi](https://github.com/georgebashi)
- [Michael Geary](https://github.com/geary)
- [Jan Hovancik](https://github.com/hovancik)
- [Bertold Kolics](https://github.com/bertold)
- Richard Moffat
- [Ilja Neumann](https://github.com/IljaN)
