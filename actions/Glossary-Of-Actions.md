# Glossary of Actions

### Abstraction (Using)

> "An abstraction" is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a common noun for all subordinate concepts and connects any related concepts as a group, field, or category.[1]

Changing abstractions is often known as _refactoring_.  Removing unnecessary or outdated abstractions is often called _simplification_.

See: 

 - [Refactoring](../risks/Complexity-Risk.md#refactoring)
 - [The Power of Abstractions](../risks/Staging-And-Classifying.md#the-power-of-abstractions)
 
 
### Standardization

Given multiple, different, competing abstractions, an effort to pick a single one and try to persuade everyone to adopt it.

See:

- [Unwritten Software (Software Dependency Risk)](../risks/Software-Dependency-Risk.md#unwritten-software)
 
### Modularisation

Breaking code up into different subsystems with limited, often well-defined interfaces to interact with them.

See: 

 - [Hierarchies and Modularisation](../risks/Complexity-Risk.md#hierarchies-and-modularisation)
 
### Dependency (Using a)

Making use of _libraries_, _services_ or _languages_ to solve a particular programming challenge.

See:

 - [Languages and Dependencies](../risks/Complexity-Risk.md#languages-and-dependencies)
 - [Software Libraries (Software Dependency Risk)](../risks/Software-Dependency-Risk.md#2-software-libraries)
 - [Software-as-a-Service (Software Dependency Risk)](../risks/Software-Dependency-Risk.md#3-software-as-a-service)

### Process Introduction

The attempt to formalize the interface for accessing a scarce or controlled resource.

See:

- [The Purpose of Process](../risks/Process-Risk.md#the-purpose-of-process)

### Automation 

Converting a manual [Process](../risks/Process-Risk) into an automatic, computer-controlled one.

See: 

 - [Automation (Meeting Reality)](../thinking/Meeting-Reality.md#example-automation)

### Compilation

Converting source code into executable binary code.  Also involves checking the consistency and internal logic of the source code.  

See:

 - [Time/Reality Tradeoff](../thinking/Cadence.md#time-reality-trade-off)

### Communication

> “The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point.” 

Includes the sub-actions or motivation, composition, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding, interpretation and reconciliation.

See:

 - [Communication Risk](./risks/Communication-Risk.md)
 
### Translation

Converting from one communication protocol to another.  Can be called a _bridge_.

See:

 - [Ecosystem Bridges](../risks/Boundary-Risk.md#ecosystem-bridges)

### Blaming

The act of shifting burden of responsibility onto someone else.  

_See: [Risk First Diagrams](../thinking/Risk-First-Diagrams.md#example_blaming_others)_

### Requirements Capture

Talking to stakeholders in order to understand what issues they need a piece of software to solve.  Often seen as an important step in building an Internal Model of a problem area before tackling a [Specification](#specification).

Also known as _market research_.

See:

 - [Waterfall (One Size Fits No One)](thinking/One-Size-Fits-No-One.md)
 
### Environmental Scanning

Understanding the operational environment of a system in order to anticipate future problems.

See: 

 - [Environmental Scanning](../risks/Operational-Risk.md#scanning-the-operational-context)


### Market Segmentation

A process by which you divide the addressable market of users for a piece of software into different types or _personas_ in order that you can tackle the requirements of a single group in isolation.

See:

 - [Feature Access Risk](../risks/Feature-Risk.md#Feature-Access-Risk)
 
### Innovation

The process of evolving a product to better manage existing or newly discovered [Feature Risk](../risks/Feature-Risk.md).  Also called _evolution_ (often when talking about ecosystems or organisms), _extension_ (when applied to standards or protocols) or _improvement_.

See:
 - [Feature Drift Risk](../risks/Feature-Risk.md#Feature-Drift-Risk)
  
 
### Marketing

The process of trying to make your product visible and attractive to potential customers by communicating the benefits to them.

> The strategic functions involved in identifying and appealing to particular groups of consumers, often including activities such as advertising, branding, pricing, and sales.

See:

 - [Market Risk](../risks/Feature-Risk.md#Market-Risk)

### Specification 

Writing a specification to describe how a piece of functionality should best mitigate [Feature Risk](../risks/Feature-Risk.md).  Also known as _design_.

See:
 - [Development Process](../thinking/Development-Process.md#example_a_toy_process)
 - [Waterfall (One Size Fits No One)](thinking/One-Size-Fits-No-One.md)

### Redundancy / Horizontal Scaling

Introducing duplication of workers or other resources in order to mitigate single-points-of-failure.

See:

- [Reliability Risk](../risks/Dependency-Risk.md#reliability-risk)

### Reserving (or Buffering)

Creating _reserves_ or _buffers_ of a scarce resource in order to deal with peaks in demand that would deplete the resource.

See:

- [Reliability Risk](../risks/Dependency-Risk.md#reliability-risk)

### Graceful Degredation

Handing lack of a scarce resource by failing in a tolerable way.

See:

- [Scarcity Risk](../risks/Scarcity-Risk.md#mitigations)

### Pools / Queues

A way of ensuring orderly consumption of scarce resources.

See: 

- [Scarcity Risk](../risks/Scarcity-Risk.md#mitigations)


## Product Development

Mitigating [Feature Risk](../risks/Feature-Risk.md) by adding code to a project.  Can often be called _coding_ or _implementation_.

_See: [Development Process](../thinking/Development-Process.md#example_a_toy_process)_

## Integration

Combining different versions of a codebase together to check for consistency.  Also called [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration).

- [Spike Solution (Coding Bets)](../bets/Coding-Bets.md#spike-solutions-a-new-technology-bet)

## Unit Testing

Writing extra (test) code in the project which can automatically check that the (main, business logic) code works correctly.

### Controlling

Keeping a _process_ performing within some acceptable parameters to achieve a goal or mitigate a risk.

See:
