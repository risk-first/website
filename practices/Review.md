## What Is It

-- retrospective
-- audit
-- reviews, generally
-- code review
-- sign off / approvals
-- training sessions
-- presentations

Also, Post IMplementation Review


[Retrospectives and Post-Implementation Reviews](Retrospective) also allow you to check your results after the fact, allowing you to learn lessons about _how_ to prioritise and _how much_ to prioritise.


After _any_ activity, you can perform a retrospective.  Level of formality may vary.

### Sign-Offs and Reviews

(See also review, code review)

Sign-Offs are used in Waterfall after each stage.  

Sign-Offs are actually a de-risking process in two ways.  

First, they allow you to [Meet Reality](Meeting-Reality.md):  taking the results of the Specification stage, and putting it in front  of a group of stakeholders gives the people on the project a chance to check their [Internal Model](Glossary.md#Internal-Model) against those of other groups, be they _users_ or _sponsors_ of the project. 

Second, they allow _lots of people_ to be involved in an approval, or a decision process.   [Extreme Programming](Agile) has a single **On Site Customer**, and can get unweildy when you have mulitple products and multiple owners within the same team.  This problem is not _solved_ by a sign-off process, but is mitigated to some extent.  

Third, they provide a written record that something was agreed.   This is useful because:
 - When mistakes arise, it's sometimes nice to be able to lay the blame elsewhere.   A simple strategy for a stakeholder is to be able to say "you didn't listen to me in the first place."
 - In the face of new information, people _revise their beliefs_, but don't often see that what they bel

Usually, it's hard to get sign-offs.  This is because it's hard to get lots of people to agree on _anything_.  The process often involves several walkthroughs, and iterations until everyone is happy.  Sadly, in order to bring people on board, the iterations usually involve _adding more complexity_ to the project, rather than reducing it, which has the effect of actually _increasing risk_.
