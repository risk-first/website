## What Is It

**Requirements Capture** is not a single technique, but a broad category of techniques such as:

- **Interviews**
- Focus Groups 
- User Stories
- Use Cases


## How It Works

Whatever exact methodology you are using, the aim is to meet **stakeholders** and try to capture their [Internal Models](Internal-Model) in written form.  This has a few effects:

- The [Internal Models](Internal-Model) of the development team can be enriched with this new information.
- You are capturing at a moment-in-time what people _thought_.  
-  As with any [Documentation](Documentation), you can to some extent reconcile the [Internal Models](Internal-Model) of a wide variety of stakeholders and implementers.

## Feedback Loops / Risks Mitigated

Requirements Capture is itself a process of [Meeting Reality](), and in a limited way:  rather than speculatively building a piece of software and trying it out on the world, Requirements Capture allows us, cheaply, to go and see what the world _thinks_ it wants, which is much _cheaper_.

### [Feature-Risk](Feature-Risk)

_Asking people what they want_ is often a way to reduce [Feature Risk](Feature-Risk) by stopping you building the wrong thing.

The feedback loop for any design is _review_.  You can also follow review with [Sign Off](Sign-Off).
