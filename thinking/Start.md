# Thinking Risk-First

Scrum, Waterfall, Lean, Prince2, DevOps:  what do they all have in common?  

One perspective is that they are individual [software methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Methodologies), offering different approaches on how to build software.

However, here, we are going to consider a second perspective:  that building software is all about _managing risk_, and that these methodologies are acknowledgements of this fact, and they differ because they have _different ideas_ about which are the most important _risks to manage_.

## "It's All About Risk"

One of the original authors of the [Agile Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Agile_Manifesto), Kent Beck states in his book:

> "It's all about risk" - [Kent Beck, _Extreme Programming Explained_](http://amzn.eu/d/gUQjnbF)

This is a promising start.  From there, he introduces his methodology, [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), and explains how you can adopt it in your team, the features to observe and the characteristics of success and failure.  However, while _Risk_ has clearly driven the conception of Extreme Programming, there is no clear model of software risk underpinning the work.

Risk-First introduces a model of software risk.  This means that we can properly analyse Extreme Programming (and Scrum, Waterfall, Lean and all the others) and _understand_ what drives them.  Since they are designed to deliver successful software projects, they must be about managing risks, and we will uncover _exactly which risks_ and _how they do it_.

## Outcome

Hopefully, after reading through some of the articles here, you'll come away with:

- An appreciation of how risk underpins everything we do as developers, whether we want it to or not.
- A framework for evaluating [software methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Methodologies) and choosing the right one for the task-at-hand.
- A new way to look at the software development process: it's an exercise in managing different kinds of risk.
- The tools to help you decide when a methodology is _letting you down_, and the vocabulary to argue for when it's a good idea to deviate from it.
