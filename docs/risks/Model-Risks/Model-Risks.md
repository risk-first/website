# Model Risks

[Model Risks](/tags/Model-Risks) are risks that arise from the mental models, abstractions, and communication systems we use to understand and build software.

Every software project depends on models: the models in our heads about how the system works, the models we use to communicate with each other, the abstractions we build into our code, and the coordination mechanisms we use to work together. When these models are wrong, incomplete, or misaligned, we face [Model Risks](/tags/Model-Risks).

## Why Model Risks Matter

Software development is fundamentally about translating ideas from one form to another—from requirements to designs to code to running systems. At each step, we rely on models:

- **Internal Models**: What each person believes to be true about the system, the requirements, or the problem domain.
- **Communication**: How we share and reconcile our models with each other.
- **Complexity**: The mental overhead of understanding how the pieces fit together.
- **Coordination**: How multiple people align their models to work towards a common goal.

When these models diverge from reality—or from each other—problems arise. Bugs get introduced, features get misunderstood, and teams work at cross-purposes.
