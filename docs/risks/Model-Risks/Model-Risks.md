# Model Risks

[Model Risks](/tags/Model-Risks) are risks that arise from the mental models, abstractions, and communication systems we use to understand and build software.

Every software project depends on models: the models in our heads about how the system works, the models we use to communicate with each other, the abstractions we build into our code, and the coordination mechanisms we use to work together. When these models are wrong, incomplete, or misaligned, we face [Model Risks](/tags/Model-Risks).
