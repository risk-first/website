# Software Development Risks

As we saw in [Risk Frameworks](/methods/Start), every framework needs a breakdown of the risks it addresses. In this section, we'll look at the different risks identified in the risk frameworks and explain them one by one.

## Main Areas

Here, risks are broken down into four main categories.
