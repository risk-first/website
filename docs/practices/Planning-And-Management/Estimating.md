## Description

> "Estimation is the process of finding an estimate, or approximation, which is a value that can be used for some purpose even if input data may be incomplete, uncertain, or unstable." - [Estimation, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation)

Estimation in software development involves predicting the time, effort, and resources needed to complete tasks or projects. Accurate estimation is crucial for planning, budgeting, and managing the development process, helping to set realistic expectations and reduce the risk of overruns.
