## Description

> "Terms of reference (TOR) define the purpose and structures of a project, committee, meeting, negotiation, or any similar collection of people who have agreed to work together to accomplish a shared goal." - [Terms of reference, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_reference)

Terms of Reference in software development define the scope, objectives, and deliverables of a project. They serve as a foundational document that guides the project team and stakeholders, ensuring that everyone has a clear understanding of what the project aims to achieve and how it will be executed.
