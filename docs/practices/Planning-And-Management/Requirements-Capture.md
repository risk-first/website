## Description

> "Requirements capture is the process of collecting information about the requirements of a system or project, typically through discussions and interactions with stakeholders." - [Requirements capture, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_capture)

Requirements Capture involves gathering and documenting the requirements for the software. This process ensures that the development team has a clear and comprehensive understanding of what needs to be built, helping to align the final product with client expectations and reducing the risk of costly changes later in the project.
