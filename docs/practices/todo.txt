HOW TO WRITE A PRACTICE PAGE
================================================================================

Each practice page follows this structure:

## 1. FRONTMATTER

```yaml
---
title: Practice Name
description: One-sentence description of what this practice does.
featured: 
  class: c
  element: '<action>Practice Name</action>'
tags: 
  - Practice Name    # The practice's own tag
  - Practice         # Always include this
practice:
  aka:               # Alternative names (3-5 typical)
   - "Alternative Name 1"
   - "Alternative Name 2"
  mitigates:         # Risks this practice helps with (include reason)
   - tag: Risk Name
     reason: "Why this practice mitigates this risk."
  attendant:         # Risks this practice introduces (include reason)
   - tag: Risk Name
     reason: "Why this practice creates this risk."
  related:           # Related practices (relative paths)
   - ../Category/Other-Practice
---
```

## 2. BODY STRUCTURE

```markdown
<PracticeIntro details={frontMatter} />

## Description

> "Wikipedia quote defining the practice." - [Title, _Wikipedia_](URL)

One or two paragraphs explaining the practice in the context of software 
development. Keep it concise.

## Variations

| **Type**     | **Description**                        | **Reference**                           |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Type 1**   | Brief description of this variation.   | [Title, Wikipedia](URL)                 |
| **Type 2**   | Brief description of this variation.   | [Title, Wikipedia](URL)                 |
| **Type 3**   | Brief description of this variation.   | [Title, Wikipedia](URL)                 |

NOTE: Only include 3-5 variations. Don't force it - if there aren't distinct
variations, fewer is fine. Avoid duplication with other practices.

EXISTING TODOS
================================================================================

1.  Risk Hierarchies
 - Need to link risk hierarchies. DONE
 - Create a special top-of hierarchy page, which lists out the other risks in the hierarchy DONE
 - Title of page should be a tag automatically. DONE

2. Check that the risks are balanced. which risks don't we use?  Why?



3.  My Glossary of Methods / Risks - we need to generate this, rather than writing it directly.   DONE
  - Write something to generate the glossary of risks and practices  DONE
  - unit testing / automated testing  DONE

4. DON'T WORK ON THINKING IN THIS BRANCH  DONE
 - Consider_payoff should use "Bets" tag. DONE
   
5. FIX LINKS AND RISK DIAGRAMS

6. - books for each method.
7. Variations for each practice, Pressure

8. Debugging bets - use the correct terms


Looking for balance: 

grep -R " - tag:" docs/practices | sed 's/.*://' | sort | uniq -c
