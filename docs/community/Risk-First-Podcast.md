Risk-First is about understanding how to manage risk in software development.

But technology is far bigger than coding, testing, and releasing. There are countless roles across the industry—each shaped by uncertainty, trade-offs, and decisions that matter.

How does risk inform those roles?  And could it be that being good at any job in technology ultimately means being good at risk management?  Is all work, in some sense… risk management?

In Risk-First: Stars of Software, Rob Moffat sits down with leaders, builders, and thinkers from across the software world to explore what they do, the risks they navigate every day, and the lessons they’ve learned along the way.

Because behind every successful system, career, and company, there is someone making thoughtful, informed decisions about risk.

If you want to excel in your chosen field, you need to understand how to manage risk well.  So who better to learn from than the stars of software?
