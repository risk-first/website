## Risk-First at XT25

The closing keynote from XT25, where Rob traces his journey from building risk systems at Deutsche Bank, RBS, and Credit Suisse to a revelatory insight: **we're not really software developers—we're risk managers**.

### What You'll Learn

Rob connects dots across two decades of financial services technology, showing how every software practice—unit testing, abstraction layers, agile ceremonies—is really about **transferring and managing risk**:

- **Risk is everywhere** — from Basel II banking regulations to your backlog tickets, it all comes down to risk
- **Patterns of risk** — just like design patterns, the same risks crop up over and over in software projects  
- **The exponential challenge** — CVEs are increasing at an alarming rate, and AI brings new risks we're only beginning to understand
- **Open source and FINOS** — how the industry is collaborating to manage shared risks around cloud, AI, and open-source adoption

As Kent Beck wrote in the first sentence of *Extreme Programming Explained*: "The basic problem of software development is risk." This talk makes the case that in the AI age, we're all becoming risk managers whether we realize it or not.
