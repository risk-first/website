## A Daft-Punk Inspired Tribute

Jose Coignard has created something truly unique: a **Daft-Punk inspired musical interpretation** of Risk-First Software Development.

This creative tribute captures the essence of thinking about software development through the lens of risk, set to electronic beats that would make any developer want to refactor their codebase.

It's not every day that a software development framework gets its own anthem, but Risk-First clearly struck a chord (sorry).
