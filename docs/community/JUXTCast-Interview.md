## JUXTCast S6E4: Risk-First Software Development

A wide-ranging conversation with Henry Garner that starts with "why doesn't agile actually work?" and ends with predictions about when AI will finally match human reliability (spoiler: give it 10,000 years).

### What's Covered

Rob and Henry dive into:

- **Rehabilitating risk management** — because it's not just for actuaries and the finance team (even if that's what developers secretly hope)
- **Why your backlog is lying to you** — every ticket is really about reducing some risk, but nobody writes it that way
- **AI: amazing tool or chaos agent?** — "I cannot leave Cursor alone for more than a couple of minutes without it going completely off the rails"
- **FINOS and open source in finance** — getting ferociously competitive banks to actually collaborate (harder than it sounds)
