## Want To Help?

If you feel something important is missing, or you spot a mistake, [we need help](https://github.com/risk-first/website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING).

Although this is a collaborative GitHub project, it's not meant to be an open-ended discussion of software techniques like [Ward's Wiki](https://wiki.c2.com). In order to be concise and useful, discussions need to be carried out by either:

- **[Opening an Issue](https://github.com/risk-first/website/issues).**
- **["Star"ing the project](https://github.com/risk-first/website/stargazers)**: this will cause you to be invited to join the Risk-First organisation
