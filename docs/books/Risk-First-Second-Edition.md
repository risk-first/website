I'm pleased to announce that the second edition of Risk-First Software Development is now available!  **265 pages** that reframe software development around the force that shapes every decision: risk.

## About Risk-First Software Development - Second Edition

**Over 20 years ago an "Agile" revolution occurred** in the software development field.  But 20 years later, the very same proponents of the revolution are turning their backs on what they created, arguing that their ideals have been corrupted by zealotry, proscriptive norms, cargo-culting and an "Agile-Industrial Complex" focused on evangelism and certification.

**Risk-First attempts something new:**   to "peel back the onion" and provide a language for understanding and evaluating not just Agile practices but _all practices_ in software development.  Unlike the Agile of today, Risk-First is not a methodology telling you what to do, but a toolbox and a pattern language to help you figure out what you should do, and help you communicate with others to make your case.

**Understand How Projects Really Work:** Not all software projects go according to plan: many fail due to overlooked problems, misaligned stakeholders, or rigid methodologies. This book offers a groundbreaking framework for thinking differently by identifying risk at the center of every decision. You’ll gain the vocabulary, tools, and confidence to identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks before they derail your project.

**All Scales Welcome:** Whether you’re managing a startup product, steering an enterprise system, or trying to incorporate new technologies such as AI, Risk-First helps you get your team aligned, spot trouble before it hits, and build software that delivers.

The book aims to develop a **Pattern Language for understanding software risk**, and develop a practical framework for discussing how the activities we take on a project change the balance of the risks we are exposed to.

**Take Control!** Whether you’re a developer, team lead, or CTO, and irrespective of your tech stack or process preference, this book furnishes you with new tools to guide projects to better outcomes. Don’t let risk control you—make it your competitive edge.

## What's Changed

This is a hugely updated and revised edition, containing a more thorough catalog of software development risks and a more in depth look at the entire risk process, from the smallest pet project up to the whole enterprise.

It contains a fully-revised taxonomy of risks, breaking down each one systematically, giving worked examples of each, a list of common threats and best practices for dealing with each, as well as high-profile examples of where these risks have caused major headaches in real-life.

It also contains two entirely new chapters dealing with technological change, responding not just to AI but the increasing pace of innovation we see globally.

In essence, this is the post-agile, AI-aware manual for understanding and harnessing the forces of innovation in play when developing software systems.
