## Of Models, Data, Architecture

 - Requiring AI developers to publish model architectures, data sources, and decision-making rationales.

 - Transparency regulations are becoming more common but face resistance from corporate interests.

## Of Generated Content

 - Increases accountability but does not prevent monopolisation directly.

 - Mandate clear labeling of AI-generated content.

 - Require accountability and auditing mechanisms for social media platforms.
 
 – Requires infrastructure for labelling, auditing, and enforcement, but could be mandated by legislation.
 
 – Transparency can deter some manipulative actors, but determined bad actors may still evade or exploit labelling.
