## Examples
  
  - **Google DeepMind’s ‘Big Red Button’ concept** (2016), proposed as a method to interrupt a reinforcement learning AI without it learning to resist interruption.  
  
  - **Hardware Interrupts in Robotics:** Physical or software-based emergency stops that immediately terminate AI operation.
