## Description

> "Scrum prescribes for teams to break work into goals to be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints. Each sprint is no longer than one month and commonly lasts two weeks. The scrum team assesses progress in time-boxed, stand-up meetings of up to 15 minutes, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: one sprint review to demonstrate the work for stakeholders and solicit feedback, and one internal sprint retrospective. A person in charge of a scrum team is typically called a scrum master." - [Scrum (software development), _Wikipedia_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)>)

Scrum is an Agile framework that focuses on iterative progress through small, cross-functional teams. Key practices in Scrum include sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. Scrum emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement, making it a popular choice for managing complex projects.
