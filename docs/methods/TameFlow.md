## Description

> "TameFlow is a holistic approach to improve the performance of collaborative knowledge-work organizations. It is based on the combination of the Theory of Constraints, Lean Thinking, and Agile practices, unified through a focus on flow." - [TameFlow, _tameflow.com_](https://tameflow.com/)

TameFlow optimises knowledge work by focusing on flow efficiency rather than resource utilisation. Its core practices—**Drum-Buffer-Rope** (from Theory of Constraints), **Buffer Management**, **Flow Efficiency Boards**, **Full-Kitting**, and **Management by Exception**—work together to identify constraints, protect against variability, and ensure work flows smoothly through the system. Unlike traditional approaches that maximise individual busyness, TameFlow maximises throughput by managing the constraint and using buffers to absorb uncertainty.
