# Software Development Risk Frameworks

A **Risk Framework** is a structured way of identifying, categorising, and addressing risks within a domain. It typically combines a breakdown of risks with recommended actions to manage them.

As the diagram shows, a risk framework employs **practices** (actions you can take) that address **risks** which obstruct your **goals**. The framework's value lies in having already identified which risks matter and which practices are effective against them.

Software methodologies like Scrum, XP, Lean, and DevOps are all risk frameworks. Each one prescribes a particular process—a set of actions to take—which is really a particular approach to managing risks on software projects.

**Pattern languages**—like the famous [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) book—are also risk frameworks. They describe common problems, the risks involved, and proven solutions. The [TVTropes](https://tvtropes.org) website is a pattern language for fiction. [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) is a pattern language for cybersecurity threats.

## Mapping a Framework

There's value in adopting a framework: it reduces cognitive load and provides battle-tested practices. But it's critical to match the framework to your project's risk profile. A framework that works well for a startup may be wrong for a regulated industry; one that suits web development may fail for embedded systems.

The frameworks below are mapped by the risks they address and the practices they recommend.
