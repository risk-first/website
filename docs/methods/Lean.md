  practices:
    - tag: Analysis
      reason: "Lean uses value stream mapping to analyze the flow of materials and information, identifying areas of waste."
      use:
        - Value Stream Mapping
    - tag: Automation
      reason: "Lean uses automation to eliminate waste and improve efficiency, especially in testing and deployment processes."
      use:
        - Pull Systems
        - Automation
    - tag: Change Management
      reason: "Lean emphasizes managing changes effectively to ensure continuous improvement and adaptability."
    - tag: Coding
      reason: "Lean practices emphasize building quality in throughout the coding process to prevent defects."
      use:
        - Build Quality In
    - tag: Configuration Management
      reason: "Lean ensures consistency and quality across different environments through configuration management."
    - tag: Debugging
      reason: "Lean uses techniques like the 'Five Whys' to identify the root cause of defects and address them effectively."
      use:
        - Root Cause Analysis
    - tag: Design
      reason: "Lean uses set-based concurrent engineering to explore multiple design options and narrow down to the best solution."
      use:
        - Set-Based Concurrent Engineering
    - tag: Estimating
      reason: "Lean focuses on working in small, manageable batches to reduce cycle time and increase feedback, aiding in more accurate estimation."
      use:
        - Small Batch Sizes
    - tag: Integration Testing
      reason: "Lean builds quality in, and integration testing is part of ensuring quality from the beginning."
      use:
        - Build Quality In
    - tag: Measurement
      reason: "Lean uses empirical data to understand and improve the development process."
      use:
        - Empirical Process Control
    - tag: Monitoring
      reason: "Lean implements pull systems where work is pulled based on demand, ensuring that no work is done until it is needed."
      use:
        - Pull Systems
    - tag: Pair Programming
      reason: "Lean encourages collaboration through cross-functional teams."
      use:
        - Cross-Functional Teams
    - tag: Performance Testing
      reason: "Lean ensures that performance is built into the product from the beginning."
      use:
        - Build Quality In
    - tag: Prioritising
      reason: "Lean uses Kanban to prioritize and manage work."
      use:
        - Kanban
    - tag: Prototyping
      reason: "Lean uses set-based concurrent engineering to explore multiple options and narrow down to the best solution."
      use:
        - Set-Based Concurrent Engineering
    - tag: Release Delivery
      reason: "Lean focuses on delivering value to the customer as quickly as possible."
      use:
        - Deliver Fast
    - tag: Retrospectives
      reason: "Lean regularly reflects on and improves the development process through continuous improvement and Kaizen."
      use:
        - Continuous Improvement
        - Kaizen
    - tag: Security Testing
      reason: "Lean ensures that security is built into the product from the beginning."
      use:
        - Build Quality In
    - tag: Stakeholder Management
      reason: "Lean emphasizes respecting people and engaging stakeholders."
      use:
        - Respect People
    - tag: Automated Testing
      reason: "Lean ensures that quality is built into the product from the beginning."

## Description

> "Lean software development is a translation of lean manufacturing principles and practices to the software development domain. Adapted from the Toyota Production System,[1] it is emerging with the support of a pro-lean subculture within the agile community. Lean offers a solid conceptual framework, values and principles, as well as good practices, derived from experience, that support agile organizations." - [Lean software development, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development)

Lean Software Development emphasizes eliminating waste, building quality in, creating knowledge, deferring commitment, delivering fast, respecting people, and optimizing the whole. Key practices in Lean include value stream mapping, pull systems, Kanban, small batch sizes, continuous improvement, root cause analysis, and respecting people. Lean focuses on improving efficiency and quality through these principles and practices.
