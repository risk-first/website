Thinking is hard.  And worrying about Risk constantly would be _exhausting_.

Life is too short to go around considering Risk Management over everything you do.  

Luckily, our brains do it for us automatically and subconsiously:  Sometimes a voice inside will cry out Wait! before we walk out into a road or try to pick up a hot teapot.   

## Habit and Experience

These subconsious reactions are borne of two things:  **habit** (we drill our children from an early age in crossing the road to embed road safety) and **experience**  (after picking up lots of too-hot kitchenware, you don't do it again).

In this section (on Methodology), we're going to focus on how **habit** can help us short-cut the Risk Management process, whilst in the next we'll look at **experience**.

When it sticks, a methodology embeds a set of practices in a team to such an extent that they become _habit_:  the team following the methodology from feature to feature or release to release without question.

## A Pattern Language

![A Pattern Language](images/generated/pattern_language.png)

It stands to reason that if [all software is about risk management](Just-Risk), then we can examine methodologies 
_themselves_ in terms of how their practices mitigate risk, and change the balance of risk on projects.  

With that in mind, we are going to examine several methodologies, and break them down into their key _practices_.  For each practice, we will look at which [Attendant Risks](Glossary#attendant-risk) it mitigates, and what [Attendant Risks](Glossary#attendant-risk) it incurs.

So _Methodology_ exists as a way 

ceremony
practices
bureacratic overhead

a point of religion.

The questions we want to ask in this section are as follows:

 -How do frameworks change the risk landscape?

What are the risks in choosing a framework?

How does choosing a framework (at all) modify our risk landscape?

How should we choose a framework, then?

Evolution of software

There are more methodologies than stars in the sky, and it's not useful to look at all of them.  Instead, we're going to pick
a few _archetypes_ and leave it at that.  

So, let's start at the beginning then, with [Waterfall](Waterfall).




### It's the same steps, but it's Sizing those steps:

Agile is per-feature delivery,
Waterfall is a bunch of features.

But, a lot of the practices end up being the same.
