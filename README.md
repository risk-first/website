The software development world is crowded with different practices, metrics, methodologies, tools and techniques.  

For example, metrics such as “number of open tickets”, “code coverage" or "release cadence" give us a numerical feel for how things are going, and methodologies such as **Scrum**, **Waterfall** and **Lean** give us different approaches to organising.

But what unites them all?

## About Risk-First

The **Risk-First** perspective is that all of these practices and methodologies have at their heart the job of managing different _risks_.   Risk isn't something that just appears in a report, it actually drives _everything we do_:

- A story about improving the user login screen can be seen as reducing _the risk of users not signing up_.
- If we write unit tests, we’re tackling _the risk of bugs going to production_, but we’re also defending against _the risk of future changes breaking our existing functionality_.
- A task about improving the health indicators could be seen as addressing _the risk of the application failing and no-one reacting to it_.
- Implementing a new function in the application is fixing _the risk that users are dissatisfied and go elsewhere_.

**Risk-First** makes the case that better understanding the nature of these risks is critical to building software in the complex, interconnected domain we work in.
